;; Scroll a yearly calendar by month -- in a forwards or backwards direction.

;; INSTRUCTIONS:

;; M-x lorg-calendar-generate
;;
;; To scroll month by month forward, use:  >
;; To scroll month by month backward, use:  <
;; To mark a new date not yet selected, use the left click on the mouse,
;;   which will also copy the date to the kill-ring.  Left-clicking on a
;;   date previously marked with the left-click will remove the overlay.
